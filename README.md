# classification-challenge - Module 13 Challenge

This challenge will have us use email meta data to separate spam from non-spam email. We'll use two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model can more accurately detect spam. One model is Logistic Regression and the other is the Random Forest Classification model.

## Source
All code is based on templates provided, and is my work.

## Where is the code?
The code module, spam_detector.ipynb, is in the top level folder of my "classification-challenge" repo.
